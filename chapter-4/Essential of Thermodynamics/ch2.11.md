# ð‘—• Joule-Thomson effect

For several years, James Prescott Joule and William Thomson â€“ both British physicists â€“ worked in collaboration, conducting experiments designed to analyze and advance thermodynamics. In 1852, the researchers made a particularly notable discovery. They found that a temperature change can occur in a gas as a result of a sudden pressure change over a valve. Known as the *Joule-Thomson effect* (or sometimes the *Thomson-Joule effect*), this phenomenon has proven to be important in the advancement of refrigeration systems as well as liquefiers, air conditioners, and heat pumps. It is also the effect that is responsible for a tire valve getting cold when you let out the air from a bicycle tire.

The temperature change pertaining to the Joule-Thomson effect can occur when a flowing gas passes through a pressure regulator, which acts as a throttling device, valve, or porous plug. Here, a temperature change is not necessarily desirable. To balance out any Joule-Thomson related temperature changes, a heating or cooling element can be used.

## Key points

- Most gases at normal temperatures are slightly cooled at throttling, with the exception of hydrogen and helium.
- The internal cooling happens because heat is converted to work that is exerted to overcome intermolecular forces.
- Ideal gas relations ignore any intermolecular forces and thus cannot capture the Joule-Thomson effect.
- The values of $\mu$ for a given gas can be found from the literature.
