# ð‘—• Internal energy

In thermodynamics, the total energy of a system is called the internal energy of the system. It is denoted by $U$. It is the sum of total kinetic energy and the potential energy of all the system's constituents, such as atoms, molecules, ions, etc. It is an extensive thermodynamics quantity that only depends upon the state of the system. In other words, $U$ is a state dependent variable.

!!! note ""
    Note that $U$ does not include the system's kinetic energy as a whole.

Genuinely speaking, the internal energy is the energy that is internal to a system. When the internal energy of the system changes from the initial value of $U_1$ to the final value of $U_2$, then the change in internal energy is defined by:

$$
\Delta U = U_2 - U_1
$$

## Internal energy in kinetic theory of gases

From the KTG, we know that a molecule has a certain number of degrees of freedom, which dictate the ability of the molecule to move in space. Consider a system of the ideal gas, which means there is no interaction between the gas molecules. Let us denote the total degree of freedom by $f$, then the total energy of a single molecule is given by

$$
E_1=\frac{f}{2}kT
$$

where, $k$ is the Boltzmann's constant. The total energy of 1 mol of molecule will be given by

$$
E_N=\frac{f}{2}kN_{A}T = \frac{f}{2}RT
$$

Here, $R$ is the universal gas constant. It is important to note that the internal energy of an ideal gas does not depend upon the system's volume because, in an ideal gas, molecules have no interaction between them. However, the molecules will interact with each other in the case of condensed gas. Therefore, potential energy also contributes to the total internal energy of the system. Nevertheless, when the temperature of the system increases, the internal energy of the system increases.

Consider a close system or body $\mathfrak{B}$. Note that we cannot see what is happening inside the body (i.e., the body is not transparent). Now the question is, how do we measure the system's internal energy? The first law of thermodynamics will provide an answer to this question.
