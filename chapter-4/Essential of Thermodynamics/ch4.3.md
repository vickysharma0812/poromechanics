# ð‘—• Thermodynamics aspects of phase change

The change of chemical potential with temperature is given by following relation.

$$
\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial T}=-S_{m} \text{ at constant pressure }
$$

- [ ] Effect of temperature on the phase change
- [ ] Effect of pressure on melting
- [ ] Effect of pressure on vapour pressure

## Effect of pressure on melting

## Effect of external pressure on vapour pressure

!!! note ""
    When pressure is applied on a condensed phase, its vapour pressure increases.

The pressure can be applied on the condensed liquid phase via mechanical loading, or by pressurized gas, which is in contact with the liquid. In the later case, vapour becomes one of the component of the gaseous phase, and the concept of _partial vapour pressure_ is used instead of the vapour pressure.
