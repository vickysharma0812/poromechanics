# ð‘—• Entropy of specific processes

## Entropy of expansion

Consider an ideal gas system which is undergoing isothermal expansion. Because the process is isothermal, we have $dU=0$, and

$$
\delta q = \delta w = pdV = \frac{nRT}{V}dV
$$

Therefore,

$$
dS = \frac{dq_{rev}}{T} = \frac{nR}{V}dV
$$

Therefore, entropy change during expansion of ideal gas under isothermal condition is given by following expression.

$$
\Delta S = nR ln(V_{2}/V_{1})
$$

The energy transferred to the surrounding will be $-dq$, therefore,

$$
\Delta S_{sur} = -nR ln(V_{2}/V_{1})
$$

Therefore,

$$
\Delta S_{tot} = 0
$$

which implies that the system and surroundings are in equilibrium to each other.

However, in case of isothermal expansion in vacuum (free space), the work done by the system is zero and $dU=0$, therefore, $\delta q=0$. In this way, the change in entropy of the surrounding is zero, and total change in entropy is given by

$$
\Delta S_{tot} = nR ln(V_{2}/V_{1})
$$

Therefore, isothermal free expansion of ideal gas is a irreversible process.

## Entropy change during phase change

Phase transition temperature is defined at 1 atm pressure, where two phases of a material are in equilibrium. When material undergoes phase transition, there is a change in entropy. However, the total change in entropy (system+surrounding) is zero because the process is reversible.

$$
\Delta S = \frac{\Delta H_{trans}}{T_{trans}}
$$

## Entropy change during heating

$$
S(T) = S(T_0) + \int_{T_0}^{T}{\frac{C_p}{T}dT}
$$
